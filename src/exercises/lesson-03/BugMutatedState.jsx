/*
  BUG #2 — State Issue

  This component displays a count and updates it when the button is clicked.
  However, the way the count is being changed causes the component to behave
  incorrectly.
*/

import { useState } from 'react';
export default function BugMutatedState() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleAdd() {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Bug 2 Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add 1</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Explanation:
// (Write your explanation here)
/*
 * Before the change, it wasn't actually updating the state, it was increased with count++ and then updated the state.
 * After the change, it was updating the state and then rerenders it onclick
